# Problem Set 1b
 
Implementing a program that first asks the user how much change is owed
and then prints the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made.
The program finally behaves like the example below..

$ ./cash                                                                                                                                                                      Change owed: -0.41 .....                                                                                                                                                            Change owed: 0.41 .....                                                                                                                                                             4
